# Software Testing

Course: [Software Testing: Get A Tech Job in Software Testing 2025 - Waqas Mazhar](https://www.udemy.com/course/get-a-job-in-technology-without-experience/)

This course focuses on the fundamentals of QA/Software testing. I plan to include some notes here, as well as examples of my projects and work.

## Testing Software & Writing Test Cases

### Gmail Test Cases 

Below, I created two test cases to test Gmail login functionality for the email `practicetypetony@gmail.com`.

- The first case tests if the user can log in with their correct credentials.
- The second case tests if the user can log in with incorrect credentials.

### Testing an office chair 

A good exercise to get into the testing mindset is to test everyday objects. Below, I wrote eight test cases for an office chair.

1. Check comfort by sitting in the chair
2. Check the wheels by moving the chair on different surfaces
3. Check the arm rest adjustments
4. Check for loose parts by moving around in the chair
5. Check the swivel by spinning in the chair
6. Check the tilt by unlocking the tilt mechanism and leaning back
7. Tip the chair over to test durability
8. Observe the markings & branding on the chair for quality

## Terminology

### Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

The SDLC is a framework of activities performed during the software development process.

| Phase | Key activities | Deliverables |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| 1. Planning | Identify project scope, goals, and requirements | Initial project plan | 
| 2. Analysis | Gather and review data on project requirements | Fully detailed requirement documentation |
| 3. Design | Define project architecture | Software design document (SDD) |
| 4. Coding | Writing inital code | Functional software prototype |
| 5. Testing | Review code and eliminate bugs | Refined, optimized software |
| 6. Deployment | Deploy code to production environment | Software available to end users |
| 7. Maintenance | Continual fixes and improvements | Updated and optimized code |
